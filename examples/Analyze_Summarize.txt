This table contains aggregated quarterly metrics across all surgical service lines. Columns include:

- `procedure_group`
- `volume_q1`, `volume_q2`, `volume_q3`, `volume_q4`
- `avg_margin`, `case_mix_index`, `length_of_stay`, `readmission_rate`

Values are standardized across facilities. The audience is an external-facing executive team looking for summary insights, risk exposure, and directional highlights.

# Notes:
# - Inputs can be structured or unstructured.
# - Settings and selections (audience, tone, bullet count) can be strict (defined in spec)
#   or loosely inferred and reinforced via context.
